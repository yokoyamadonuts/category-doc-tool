# Set Theory Fundamentals

Set theory is the branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which are collections of objects.

## Basic Concepts

### Sets and Elements

A **set** is a collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. The objects that make up a set are called **elements** or **members**.

### Set Notation

- `{a, b, c}` - A set containing elements a, b, and c
- `x ∈ A` - x is an element of set A
- `x ∉ A` - x is not an element of set A

### Important Sets

- `∅` or `{}` - The empty set
- `ℕ` - Natural numbers
- `ℤ` - Integers
- `ℚ` - Rational numbers
- `ℝ` - Real numbers
- `ℂ` - Complex numbers

## Set Operations

### Union

The **union** of sets A and B, denoted `A ∪ B`, is the set of all elements that are in A, in B, or in both.

### Intersection

The **intersection** of sets A and B, denoted `A ∩ B`, is the set of all elements that are in both A and B.

### Difference

The **difference** of sets A and B, denoted `A \ B`, is the set of all elements that are in A but not in B.

## Functions Between Sets

A **function** `f: A → B` is a relation that assigns to each element of set A exactly one element of set B.
